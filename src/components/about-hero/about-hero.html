      <div class="about-hero__subtitle">
        We restore leather, vinyl, and eco-leather—every day, no weekends or holidays, since 2024.
        People call us “wizards,” but it’s not magic—it’s years of hands-on experience.

          Tried a DIY fix first? You’re not alone. We’ve seen the “liquid leather,” iron-on patches,
          and cheap kits. Most of the time, they make things worse. Trust us—professional repair
          costs less than fixing failed DIY attempts.

          Restoration isn't patchwork—it's real craftsmanship. And detailing? Flossing your teeth.
          Do it every day, and you won't have to repair anything major later.

          We've experimented with almost every product and process out there. <br />
          No one-size-fits-all. We keep learning, testing, and refining—because being the best is
          never a fixed thing.
